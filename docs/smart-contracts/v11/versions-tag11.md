> We have updated our versioning system to improve modularity and maintainability.
> From now on, each contract will have its own isolated version, independent from the versions of other contracts or the repository as a whole. This change enables better tracking of contract-specific updates and simplifies version management across the system.
> To keep things simple and consistent, we are initializing each contract with version v1.0.0. Future updates will follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) on a per-contract basis.
